## Project abstract

This quantitative study uses Multiple Linear Regression Analysis to determine the effect of country-level vulnerability to climate catastrophe and public opinion (divided into the salience of climate emergency and the belief that immediate action should be taken to address it) on the comprehensiveness of national climate change policies. To determine these relations, we account for extraneous factors proven to affect climate regulation – specifically, countries’ greenhouse gas emission levels (GHGs), Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Human Development Index (HDI). We find that there is no statistically significant association between climate vulnerability and the comprehensiveness of countries’ climate policies. Rather, a nation’s climate regulation levels are influenced by extraneous factors such as the ones stated above. On the other hand, public opinion, including the salience of climate emergency and the will to enact change displays a strong positive correlation with the level of national climate policies. This finding demonstrates the applicability of general literature on public opinion affecting policymaking to the issue of climate change and has implications for encouraging both climate regulation and the wider topic of public opinion’s influence in authoritarian states.
